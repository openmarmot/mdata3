mdata3 change log 

----------------------------------
May 09 2025 
- replaced input with get_input_with_timeout where appropriate
- added a version number
- minor cleanup

now if you forget to hit enter after doing a secret search or a otp display the app will gracefully close
after the input times out. this used to only be the case for the main menu

----------------------------------
April 28 2025 
- updated timeout behavior so it exits cleanly 

this fixes a long standing bug where when the program times out 
it hangs and you have to hit enter to get it to fully exit
