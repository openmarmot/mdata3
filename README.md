# mdata3
mdata3 is the third version of a password manager I've made for my personal use. The major change with this version is the inclusion of a One Time Password (OTP) Generator.

Note : The data is encrypted with a simple cypher. This intended for use in an environment that is already secure and encrypted by default.
